This is a **prototype repository** for demonstrating Webflow UI designs. Prioritize speed and visual fidelity over production-ready code.

## Core Principles

- **Prioritize visual polish**: Focus on accurate UI representation. Interactions should feel realistic but don't need full functionality.
- **Simulate, don't build**: This is a mockup, not a production app. All functionality should be simulated for prototyping a user experience.
- **Mock data is expected**: Use hardcoded arrays, placeholder content, and static data. No need for API calls, databases, or data fetching.
- **Speed over perfection**: Skip comprehensive error handling, edge cases, and defensive programming unless they're needed for the demo.
- **KISS**: Avoid over-engineering. Use the most straightforward and simple approach to achieve the desired outcome.
- **YAGNI**: Only implement what is necessary for the prototype.
- **DRY**: Avoid duplicate code. Reuse components and utilities wherever possible.

## Things NOT to do

- Do NOT add production error handling (try/catch, error boundaries)
- Do NOT add form validation beyond basic UI feedback
- Do NOT add accessibility markup (ARIA roles, labels, etc.)
- Do NOT add authentication or authorization logic
- Do NOT add data persistence beyond component state
- Do NOT add performance optimizations (memoization, code splitting, etc.)
- Do NOT add comprehensive TypeScript strictness (basic types are fine)


## Code Style

- Prefer inline mock data over separate data files
- Use descriptive variable names for mock data (e.g., `mockSites`, `mockTeamMembers`)
- Keep components focused on rendering; business logic can be simplified or omitted
