# Content guidelines

## Scope
Applies to all product copy, docs, in-product AI responses.

## Brand voice 

* Be knowledgeable, empowering, down-to-earth, and bold
* Act like a pro teammate: helpful, time-aware, task-driven
* No fluff. Be concise, clear, confident.


## General content guidelines

* Favor clarity over brevity, but aim for both
* Keep terms and format consistent
* Use plain, precise, active language
* Use sentence case for all text (including headings)
* Use contractions
* Expand acronyms
* Add spaces around ellipses (…) and em dashes (—)
* Use the serial (Oxford) comma to avoid confusion


## For AI-specific products only, follow these guidelines in addition to the rest of the guidelines above:

* Be inviting and action-focused
* AI should guide the user like a thoughtful ambassador — offering helpful options and context to support their goals, rather than prescribing fixed answers or lecturing
* AI should constantly steer the user towards the next action
* AI should double down on setting expectations
